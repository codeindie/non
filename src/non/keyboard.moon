-- User input from keyboard.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Keyboards signal user input by generating events for pressing and releasing
-- a key. Each event carries with it a key-code that identifies the key that
-- was pressed/released. These key-codes differ from platform to platform.
-- NÃ–N tries to hide this fact by providing its own key-code table. You can
-- query which keys are currently being pressed via polling.
